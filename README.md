# Matchtigs: minimum plain text representation of kmer sets

This is an implementation of different algorithms for computing small and minimum plain text representations of kmer sets.
The algorithms expect unitigs as an input, which can e.g. be computed with [BCALM2](https://github.com/GATB/bcalm).

## Requirements

Rust `>= 1.56.1`, best installed via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## Usage

Install `matchtigs` with
```bash
cargo install matchtigs
```
